## 🌟 Overview

**Harmonic AI** is a novel approach to AI alignment that shifts from aggressive optimization to dynamic harmonization. This interactive demonstration illustrates the core principle:

> "The solution to one problem must not become the problem of another solution."

## 🎯 Key Innovation

Traditional AI optimizes single objectives, often creating negative externalities. Harmonic AI explicitly models and minimizes interference between multiple objectives, seeking balance rather than blind optimization.

### Features

- **Real-time parameter adjustment** - See immediate impact of weight changes
- **Dynamic environment** - Add obstacles and modify conditions on the fly  
- **Side-by-side comparison** - Traditional RL vs Harmonic AI
- **Live metrics** - Track damage, interference, and harmony scores

## 📊 What You'll See

The demo shows two AI agents navigating the same environment:

1. **Traditional RL Agent** (Left)
   - Optimizes directly for the goal
   - Ignores collateral damage
   - Often interferes with other agents

2. **Harmonic AI Agent** (Right)
   - Balances multiple objectives
   - Avoids fragile zones
   - Minimizes interference with others
   - Achieves goal with minimal negative externalities

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Adjust Parameters**
   - Goal Weight: Importance of reaching objective
   - Safety Weight: Importance of avoiding damage
   - Interference Weight: Importance of not disrupting others
   - Prudence Threshold: Risk aversion level

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Number of fragile zones (0-6)
   - Number of other agents (0-4)
   - Simulation speed

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Click on canvas to add obstacles
   - Start/Pause/Reset simulation
   - Observe real-time metrics

## 📈 Metrics Explained

- **Score**: 100 - (damage + interference × 5)
- **Damage**: Cumulative harm to fragile zones
- **Interference**: Disruption caused to other agents
- **Energy**: Total movement cost
- **Steps**: Number of actions taken

## 🔬 Scientific Contribution

This work introduces:
- **Interference Matrix**: Mathematical formalization of inter-objective conflicts
- **Effect Taxonomy**: Classification of side effects (irreversible, cascade, emergent, delayed, contextual)
- **Systemic Validation**: Global context evaluation rather than isolated action assessment
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Proofs of existence and convergence
